      <h2>Proposition: There is Racial Bias Within the NYPD</h2>

        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

          <figcaption>Total civilian complaints against white officers increased during Bloomberg’s tenure, alluding to clear racial disparities.  </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The most important design decision we took in this chart was to interpret the data as total complaints, rather than average complaints, percent change in complaints, or complaints per officer.
            We rate this decision 1.5 on the diverging scale, where -2 is fully deceptive and 2 is fully earnest.
            We feel that this more accurately reflects the impacts of stop and frisk as felt by New Yorkers. Measuring total complaints per year shows a clear increase over time that relates an increase in complaints against white officers with the era of stop-and-frisk as enforced by Bloomberg. Shorter or taller scales that stretched the graph felt deceptive, so we opted for this scale. To present the data as-is, we did not alter the y-axis. We did not opt to make it logarithmic, for example.
          </li>
          <li>We chose to emphasize Bloomberg in the title, making sure to put front and center the connection between his tenure as mayor and changes in complaints against white officers.
              We rate this decision a 1.5 on the diverging scale, where -2 is fully deceptive and 2 is fully earnest.
              While stop-and-frisk has existed as a New York policy for a while, it was Bloomberg who made the choice to enforce it in a much more present and controversial way. Highlighting his role and connecting him directly uses the memory of his mayorship to contribute to our argument. Other titles that did not invoke him directly seemed to be too shy around the point.
          </li>
          <li>We chose to annotate the chart with the approximate number of complaints per year against white officers at the beginning and end of Bloomberg’s tenure.
              We rate this decision a 2 on the diverging scale, where -2 is fully deceptive and 2 is fully earnest.
              We found upon looking at the chart ourselves and showing it to others that it was more legible with the numbers included, than when we purely tried to estimate off of height. This is especially true for those with poor eyesight, or when the chart is being observed in poor lighting or from an angle. Adding the numbers to fetch attention guarantees eyes on the 3x growth over Bloomberg’s time as mayor

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="plots/image2.jpg" alt="">
          <figcaption>Average complaints per officer follow a stable trend, suggesting lack of disparities.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The most important design decision we took in this chart was to interpret the data as complaints per officer, rather than total complaints.
              We rate this decision -1.5 on the diverging scale, where -2 is fully deceptive and 2 is fully earnest.
              Splitting up complaints per officer drastically flattened the scale, as a way to intentionally suppress evidence of complaints’ growth during Bloomberg’s tenure as mayor. Compared to alternatives like logarithmically scaling the y-axis on total complaints or sampling a narrow band of years, it looks less overtly suspicious. The extended period of time with all three lines close together yet fluctuating seemed natural to us. This at face value to the viewer can seem convincing of the argument that there are no racial disparities between the groups based on the fairly flat, stable growth patterns and lack of spiking.
          </li>
          <li>We chose to highlight the years of Bloomberg’s tenure as mayor in a darker color of gray as compared to the rest of the graph’s background.
              We rate this decision 2 on the diverging scale, where -2 is fully deceptive and 2 is fully earnest.
              We needed a way to highlight the exact boundaries of Bloomberg’s tenure to make our argument about what those years contained more convincing. Using a different shade was clearer than using dashed lines, and less obtrusive to reading the chart than using a more saturated color.
          </li>
          <li>We chose to make the line representing white officers a distinctly different color from the lines representing black and hispanic officers, which are much closer together in both hue and value.
              We rate this decision 1 on the diverging scale, where -2 is fully deceptive and 2 is fully earnest.
              We wanted to draw attention to the trends regarding white officers, since exploring them is the main purpose of our chart. It was also key to us that we use these colors or others like them to make our chart friendly to those with red-green colorblindness, by avoiding red and green. Other color combinations, such as purple and orange, either looked strange to us or did not stand out as well.
          </li>
          <li>We chose to emphasize stop-and-frisk as a policy in the title, as opposed to making any explicit reference to then-Mayor Bloomberg immediately.
               We rate this decision -1 on the diverging scale, where -2 is fully deceptive and 2 is fully earnest.
               Stop-and-frisk has been a policy in New York City since the 80s and 90s, but it came into much heavier focus during the Bloomberg mayorship. By referring to the policy instead of the mayor in bolder words, we draw attention away from his guilt in causing more controversial enforcement by minimizing his name and maximizing emphasis on the policy itself.

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p>
          For us, finding a part of the dataset that could support a claim and counter-claim on any given issue regarding the conduct, efficacy, or incidence rate of the New York Police Department was very difficult. For the vast majority of data we arranged, we rapidly discovered a clear conclusion. No matter the timeframe, area of the city, or interpretation of the question sampled, these conclusions remained similar or the same. 
          Opposing these conclusions would have required the use of modification so excessive as to be obviously deceitful from the outset, defeating the point of the exercise. It was only near the end that we had the idea of dividing complaints over the number of officers, creating a sufficiently reasonable-looking deception. We were surprised by the inherent resistance of the data to being manipulated this way. However, we found the act of charting itself relatively straightforward. 
          Since the information was presented as a change in data over time, it was clear to us that a line plot would be the strongest visualization method, which we used from our earliest drafts to our final submission.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ethical analysis and visualization, from our point of view, does not make it its business to distort data away from its natural conclusion. Any data can be hacked by introducing additional variables or restricting existing ones, but this does not change the real-world expression and consequence of that data. 
          In the case of our claim, the personal stories of people who live or lived in New York City strongly support the conclusion of our earnest visualization. Ethical analysis connects itself to the people or phenomena that it describes and attempts to remain true to them, rather than distort their experiences for the sake of an ulterior argument. 
          To some extent, however, we believe that it is the business of the reader to discern what is and is not misleading, or manipulative. So long as a chart does not outright lie or contradict its data, some of the burden lies on the reader for being compelled by a misinterpretation. Ultimately, the nature of how the data is framed and presented dictates how the story of racial bias within the NYPD is told.
